# How Effective are Time Series Models for Pandemic Forecasting?

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper "How Effective are Time Series Models for Pandemic Forecasting?". This research explores the effectiveness of various time series models in predicting pandemics. 

The code base is composed of three types of experiments:
  - [Train-Test Split](#train-test-split)
  - [Rolling Window](#rolling-window)
  - [CDC Experiments](#cdc-experiments)

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main directories corresponding to the different experimental setups used in the paper:
- `train-test-split/`: Contains the code and data for experiments using a traditional train-test split approach.
- `rolling-window/`: Contains the code and data for experiments using a rolling window approach.
- `cdc-experiments/`: Contains the code and data for experiments conducted using CDC guidelines and data.
