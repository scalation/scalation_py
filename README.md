This repository is a comprehensive collection of models, transformations, and experiments focused on **pandemic forecasting**, with an emphasis on **multivariate time series modeling** using both statistical and deep learning methods.

Developed as part of a Ph.D. research, this toolkit has statistical models like **SARIMAX**, state-of-the-art architectures such as **Transformer-based networks**, and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**.
