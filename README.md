# Branch: dev_sr

This repository is a comprehensive collection of models, transformations, and experiments focused on **pandemic forecasting**, with an emphasis on **multivariate time series modeling** using both statistical and deep learning methods.

Developed as part of a Ph.D. research, this toolkit includes statistical models, neural networks, and deep learning models including **SARIMAX**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU)**, **Sequence-to-Sequence models with/without Attention**, **Transformer-based architectures**, and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for multivariate time series forecasting.

> 🔍 **Note:** All experiments, models, and implementations related to this research are maintained in the [`dev_sr`](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_py/tree/dev_sr) branch, which contains the author's individual contributions, including advanced normalization techniques, graph-based modeling, and transformers for multivariate time series.

## Main Projects

### [A3T-GCN](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_py/tree/dev_sr/A3T-GCN)
Implements a modified Attention Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for COVID-19 forecasting across U.S. states using Pearson correlation and mutual information-based adaptive graphs.  
📄 *Published as:* [*Exploring the Predictive Power of Correlation and Mutual Information in A3T-GCN* (Springer, 2023)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44725-9_2)

### [PandemicForecasting](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_py/tree/dev_sr/PandemicForecasting)
Benchmarks 16 statistical and deep learning models for forecasting COVID-19 and ILI cases. It highlights that model effectiveness does not always align with complexity. The project evaluates real-world CDC models across early-stage and large-scale pandemic scenarios, incorporates a retraining strategy to handle scarce data, and applies targeted hyperparameter tuning to improve model generalization.

### [Normalizations](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_py/tree/dev_sr/Normalizations)
Transformer models for time series forecasting often rely on standard normalization methods, which can struggle with tackling real-world data challenges such as distributional shifts, skewness, non-stationarity, and heteroscedasticity. This project explores the integration of robust statistical preprocessing techniques—including log, Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, square root, and differencing—into transformer-based architectures. The objective is to tackle real-world data challenges and improve time series forecasting. 📄 *Submitted to [EuroSys 2026](https://2026.eurosys.org/)*. 

### Datasets
You can obtain the infectious disease datasets from the [datasets](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_py/tree/dev_sr/datasets) folder, and the other six benchmarks from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy).
