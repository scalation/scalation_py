This repository is a comprehensive collection of models, transformations, and experiments focused on **pandemic forecasting**, with an emphasis on **multivariate time series modeling** using both statistical and deep learning methods.

Developed as part of a Ph.D. research, this toolkit has traditional models like **SARIMA**, modern architectures such as **Transformer-based networks** and **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**, enhanced through advanced preprocessing techniques.
