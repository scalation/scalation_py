# Branch: dev_sr

This repository is a comprehensive collection of models, transformations, and experiments focused on **pandemic forecasting**, with an emphasis on **multivariate time series modeling** using both statistical and deep learning methods.

Developed as part of a Ph.D. research, this toolkit includes statistical models, neural networks, and deep learning models including **SARIMAX**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU)**, **Sequence-to-Sequence models with/without Attention**, **Transformer-based architectures**, and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for multivariate time series forecasting.

> üîç **Note:** All experiments, models, and implementations related to this research are maintained in the [`dev_sr`](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_py/tree/dev_sr) branch, which contains the author's individual contributions, including advanced normalization techniques, graph-based modeling, and transformer adaptations for multivariate time series.
