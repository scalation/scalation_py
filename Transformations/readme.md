# Improving Channel-Independent Transformer via Statistical Preprocessing for Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper *"Improving Channel-Independent Transformer via Statistical Preprocessing for Time Series Forecasting."* The project demonstrates how integrating advanced statistical preprocessing techniques can improve the performance of channel-independent transformer models in time series forecasting.

## Requirements

Before running the code, please ensure that the following Python packages are installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- torch==1.11.0

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn torch==1.11.0
